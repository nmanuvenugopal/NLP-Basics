# Stemming

Stemming is a text normalization technique used in natural language processing (NLP) and information retrieval to reduce words to their root form or base form. The root form is also called the "stem."
The purpose of stemming is to improve the efficiency of text analysis, information retrieval, and language processing by treating different forms of a word as the same entity.

For example, consider the words "running," "runs," and "runner." By applying stemming, these words can be reduced to their common root "run."

Stemming algorithms work by removing prefixes, suffixes, and other word variations to derive the stem. This process might not always result in a valid word, as the stem is often a fragment of a word. 
However, the goal of stemming is not to produce proper words but to group similar words together for analysis. 

There are various stemming algorithms available in NLP, with the most common ones being:

1. Porter Stemming Algorithm: This is one of the oldest and most widely used stemming algorithms. It applies a set of heuristic rules to strip off common suffixes from words.

2. Snowball (Porter2) Stemming Algorithm: An improved version of the Porter algorithm, Snowball provides stemming algorithms for multiple languages.


Stemming can be useful in various NLP tasks such as text classification, sentiment analysis, and information retrieval. However, it's important to note that stemming might not always result in accurate or valid word forms.
In some cases, more advanced techniques like lemmatization (which aims to reduce words to their base or dictionary form) might be preferred, especially when maintaining meaningful words is important.In summary, 
stemming is a technique in NLP that reduces words to their root forms to improve text analysis and processing efficiency, even though the resulting stems might not always be valid words.
